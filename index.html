                <p>In the cases a cat hides, it could mean he feels danger or is sick. This could be because of an infection or a feeling the cat dislikes. Ive come to
                    this conclusion because of a personal expierence with my own cat, he had been hiding for a while when I realized he had an infection.
                    He was peeing blood and was slowly dying, I was able to notice and brought him to the vet immidently.
