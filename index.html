                    He was peeing blood and was slowly dying, I was able to notice and brought him to the vet immidently.` <b>( This is just my own expierence, other cats can act

        <h1 id="myExpert">My Expeirence</h1>
        <p>During 2021, I had gotten my first kitten. My father had rescued him from a road he drove to get back from work, with my mother. 
            The two saw the kitten come towards them and my mother adored the kitty. He was so small and blonde, with beautiful blue eyes and
            the softest fur I've ever touched. My mother had sent a picture to me while she was on her way home with my father, the two had bought
            a tower the kitty could sleep on. As soon as the two came home with the kitty, my world changed. (REAL.) I became a more understanding 
            person, but shortly after the kitten got sick. He started to hide from us and refused to eat, I'd cry everytime we left the house to Find
            something that could help the kitten. We took the kitten to the vet and shortly after a while, the kitten had an infection. This accured (
                according to the vet) that we did not clean its litter enough. No one stayed home during the kittens stay at our house, so no one would
                help him. I'd try to make an effort and change it's water and food everyday, but school had been draining me. The vet charged us
                3000 dollars to help our kitten. He was suffering and had a small surgery done on his stomach, that had puss inside. We would have
                to make an effort to help. The vet gave us medicine and told us to look after it everyday. A couple weeks passed with our daily visits,
                and the kitten started to get better. His surgery wound was healing and he started to play more. This was a relief to find out he was
                doing better. This event felt like I was losing a family member of my own. The pain was unbearable, to live and see something you love 
                pass away hurts so much. After this happened, I cherished every moment with anyone like a diamond I could lose in a sewer. Happy memories 
                create a positive enviornment for head, though when that person is gone, it hurts. To relive those moments in your own head create an 
                unbearable pain, a deep sorrow that hurts forever. But it'll be okay.
