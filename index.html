                <h1>Purrrr..</h1>
                <p> When a cat <b>purs</b>, it can be a sign of affection towards you. In most cases, it has a meaning where the cat is showing that they trust you,
                    they're glad you're their owner and are happy to see you. For example, when you get home from a hard day at work, your cat is most likely
                    to rub their head on your leg. They are checking you came back alive from hunting, and are happy to see you! <b>( cats think you go out hunting
                    for their food, yeah its a bit funny. )</b>

                <h1>Belly Show, Belly Hide</h1>
                <p> Cats can be very protective over their <b>bellys</b>. It has a cats vital organs and can be very sensitive for a human to
                    touch, but when a cat shows their <b>belly</b> to you, you know you have one over their trust. Cats that show their <b>belly</b> near you
                    can mean that they trust being around you, they trust you protect them. In most cases, cats doing this does not mean they want a belly 
                    rub, each cat can have their own prefence. <b>( When I try to touch my cats belly, he bites me. )</b>
                    </p>

            <div class="column">
                <h1>Hidings</h1>
                <p>In the cases a cat <b>hides</b>, it could mean he feels danger or is sick. This could be because of an infection or a feeling the cat dislikes. Ive come to
                    this conclusion because of a personal expierence with my own cat, he had been hiding for a while when I realized he had an infection.
                    He was peeing blood and was slowly dying, I was able to notice and brought him to the vet immidently.` <b>( This is just my own expierence, other cats can act
                    differently! )</b>
